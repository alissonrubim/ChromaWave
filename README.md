# ChromaWave
ChromaWave was an idea that I had to make all my blinking led devices dance at the sound of a music. 
So I decide to start this little (at first) project. The goal was create a easy way to see a Audio Spectrum and link it with your devices.

## Screens
### Effects screen
This screen shows the possible effects that you can choose.
For now, the only available effect is the Music effect. But in the future, I'll implement more.
